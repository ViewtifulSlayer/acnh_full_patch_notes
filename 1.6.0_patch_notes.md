Events and holidays
Turkey Day

Franklin getting ready to cook.
Harvest Festival has been renamed to Turkey Day in its return in 1.6.0, but the event is still hosted by Franklin as with New Leaf. During this event, Franklin will ask the player to collect various ingredients for four dishes in exchange for a Turkey Day rug, a Turkey Day wall, a Turkey Day flooring, and a cornucopia in order. If the player has difficulties getting a specific ingredient, villagers that are inside their house will exchange ingredients. Each dish also has a secret ingredient that, if given to Franklin, will give a Turkey Day Series furniture that can only be crafted. If the player manages to give Franklin a secret ingredient for every dish, he will give the player the Cozy Turkey Day DIY

For northern hemisphere players, Turkey Day is taken as a celebration of the fall harvest, while for Southern Hemisphere players it is taken as a celebration of spring. This is reflected by every furniture outside of Resident Services and the Turkey Day Series being customized for their respective hemispheres, and the change in ingredients that are required for each dish. If the player misses Turkey Day, from after Turkey Day until the end of November, Nook's Cranny will sell the Cozy Turkey Day DIY pack and Turkey Day furniture for  19,800 Bells.

This event is time-locked, and only unlocks on 1.6.xa.

Toy Day

The player giving a gift to Sherb.
Toy Day, and its host Jingle, return in 1.6.0. In the days preceding Toy Day, Nook's Cranny will sell a random toy and Able Sisters will sell Festive-related clothing. This portion is time-locked, and only occurs on 1.6.xb.

During Toy Day itself, Jingle will give the player a DIY recipe for the festive wrapping paper, and asks for them to craft three for him. Once completed, the player given a Toy Day stockings and Jingle gives the player the task to deliver gifts to every villager. If the player has a high friendship with a villager, when the player gives them their gift, the villager will give the player a toy item back. After completing the task, the player will earn the gift pile DIY. If the player hangs up their Toy Day Stockings on Toy Day, then from December 31 to January 1, the player can receive Jingle's photo. Toy Day itself is time-locked, and only unlocks on 1.6.xc.

In a first in the series, Toy Day has two variants of its composition. A festive, calming rendition for Toy Day in the northern hemisphere and an upbeat, vibrant rendition for Toy Day in the southern hemisphere.

Changed features
The availability of the sunflower crown and midwinter sweater were changed. Previously, the items were available in both hemispheres around June 6 to July 7. In 1.6.0, this was changed in that the items associated with their respective season would only appear on the hemispheres that were experiencing those seasons. In this instance for December, the midwinter sweater was only available for northern hemisphere players for the Winter Solstice, and the sunflower crown was only available for southern hemisphere players for the Summer Solstice.
Leif now sells pumpkin starts year-round instead of limited to just October.
The names of the following items were changed:
Summer-solstice crown → Sunflower crown
Winter-solstice sweater → Midwinter sweater
Bug fixes
Any tables created to duplicate miscellaneous furniture items on 1.2.0 prior to the 1.2.1 patch will no longer work.
