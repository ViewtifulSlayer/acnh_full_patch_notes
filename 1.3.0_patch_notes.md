Sea creatures and swimming

A player going out to swim.
Sea creatures and the swimming mechanic make their return in 1.3.0. In order to obtain sea creatures, the player must obtain a wet suit from either Nook's Cranny, Nook Shopping, or Nook Stop.

There are 40 sea creatures in total, ten more than New Leaf. New sea creatures include sea pig, slate pencil urchin, moon jellyfish, mussel, whelk, gigas giant clam, umbrella octopus, vampire squid, firefly squid, gazami crab, dungeness crab, sea pineapple, and Venus' flower basket. The ear shell, clam, and horsehair crab did not return from New Leaf. The museum will host any sea creatures in the already existing fish exhibit.

New characters
Pascal

The player catching a Scallop, with Pascal behind the player.
Pascal makes his return in 1.3.0, appearing when a player catches a Scallop. If the player chooses to give their scallop to Pascal, he will give them either a DIY recipe in the Mermaid Series, a mermaid fishy dress, a mermaid princess dress, or a pearl. Pearls can also be found from a small, stationary shadow, and can be used for DIY recipes. However, Pearls are not considered a sea creature.

Gullivarrr

The player encountering Gullivarrr.
Gullivarrr was a new NPC added in 1.3.0, with a similar mission as Gulliver, but requiring the player to dive in to find his communicator. When completed, he will mail the player any furniture from the Pirate Series or pirate-themed clothing.

Events and holidays

Bamboo grass placed on a player's island.
A new Nook Shopping seasonal event has been added. To celebrate Tanabata, a traditional Japanese festival, bamboo grass is available to purchase throughout July.

Character changes
Leif, Saharah, and Kicks are no longer guaranteed to show up every week. Instead, any special visitor can appear on any weekday. In the result of the change to NPC schedules, K.K. Slider now appears on Sundays instead of a Friday in the case of an event taking place on Saturday.
Saharah can now allow the player to continue the conversation after buying an item.
Wisp's item gifts chances have changed slightly. His clothing category price range of 300 –  4,999 Bells has changed to 300 –  2,999 Bells.
Bug fixes
Several fish names in Korean and Simplified Chinese were corrected.
A glitch to hide the camera UI was fixed, although the ability to hide the camera UI would be added in the 1.4.0 Summer Update (Wave 2).
An issue where players could walk out of bounds by using a table or a bench item was fixed.
An issue where a new villager would assume the exterior of the previously moved-out villager, commonly caused by time traveling backwards, was fixed.
