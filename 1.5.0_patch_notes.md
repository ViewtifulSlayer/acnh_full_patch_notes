Villagers on Halloween.
Halloween, alongside Jack, returns in 1.5.0. For the remainder of October, the player can purchase Spooky Series furniture and one candy for day in Nook's Cranny. During the month of October, Able Sisters will sell costumes related to Halloween, while Kicks will exclusively sell the impish wings.

Pumpkin starts are available to purchase in both Nook's Cranny and Leif, and planting them will produce pumpkins for use in DIY recipes for the Spooky Series. There are four pumpkin colors: orange, yellow, green, and white. Only orange pumpkins are used in crafting, while yellow, green, and white pumpkins act akin to customization kit.

On Halloween itself, the player has to do trick or treating with their villagers, but unlike previous games, treating will allow the player to earn prizes, while being tricked messes up the player's skin tone and eye contact while also adding a face paint. Jack will roam around the island asking the player to give him either candy or lollipop. The former will give the player Jack's robe and Jack's face which will scare any villagers into giving candy. The latter will give the player a spooky carriage, the DIY recipe for Spooky Carriage, and a DIY recipe for a spooky wand. Failure to give these treats will result in Jack messing the player's skin tone, eye color, and face paint.

Other changes
