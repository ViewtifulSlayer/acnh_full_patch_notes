The Roost

Brewster asking the player if they want a cup of coffee.
The Roost café, manned by Brewster, returns as an expanded wing of the museum. Special characters may visit periodically to purchase coffee. An amiibo phone allows amiibo to be scanned to invite characters to The Roost. Occasionally, they may bring other characters with them for their visit. If the player invites a villager who used to live on their island, the villager will remember the player and their island.

Boat tours

The player exploring an island after riding with Kapp'n.
Kapp'n appears in his boat at the island's pier and will take the player on a boat tour for  1,000 Nook Miles once per day, letting the player discover several new islands, differing from the original suite of islands that could be visited.

Many of these islands feature a gyroid fragment for the player to dig up and replant on their island. Some islands have distinct floras, with one set of islands featuring vines and glowing mosses. Many of these islands also experience a different season or time of day to the player's own island, allowing the player to obtain items and DIY recipes out of season.

Harv's Island expansion

Harv's Island, with Harriet, Kicks, Redd, and Leif set up.
Harv's Island has been expanded to the north to include a new shopping area, styled as a commune.  100,000 Bells must be raised for each plot to invite special characters to set up a permanent shop:

Harriet gives the player exclusive haircuts, and will teach them how to create these styles so that the player can subsequently choose them using a mirror.
Saharah sells wallpaper, flooring, and rugs, several of which are exclusive to her shop.
Kicks sells shoes, socks, and bags.
Leif sells starts, bushes, and flowers, and will weed the player's island.
Redd sells art and runs a raffle stand, allowing the player to get various holdable items.
Cyrus and Reese can redesign furniture variations that cannot be customized using a DIY workbench.
Katrina performs fortune readings for the player to determine their luck for the day. She can also look into the player's friendship for specific villagers.
Tortimer allows the player to access their personal storage unit. If playing during fall, Tortimer is replaced by Cornimer, who gives the player acorns when talked to.
Additionally, all special characters who have an amiibo but were not available before this update can now be invited to Photopia.

Home and player improvements

The player's house using two walls adjacent to each other.
Three new storage upgrades are available, beyond the upgrade to 2,400 items offered in the Ver. 1.6.0 update. The player's total storage capacity can now be subsequently upgraded to 3,200, 4,000, and 5,000 items, for 700,000, 900,000, and 1,200,000 Bells, respectively. Recipes can now also be placed into storage.

The exterior shape of the player's house can now be customized between 4 different styles, similar to a feature present in Animal Crossing: New Leaf. These styles include the default wood and stone appearance, a log cabin, a rounded stucco design, and a Japanese castle aesthetic. These all match the various stylings of the villager houses present in the game. The costs for customizing and moving houses have also been reduced.

22 new furniture series and furniture sets were added.

Artsy Set
Bug Head Set
Castle Set
Chalkboard Set
Cool Series
Dreamy Series
Elegant Series

Players can now move within the gaps between tightly spaced furniture, allowing for access to places that were previously blocked with this density of furniture placement. A Pro Decorating License can be purchased from the Nook Stop, allowing the player to place new ceiling-mounted objects and to create accent walls by selectively applying wallpaper on individual walls. Custom Designs Patterns+ can be purchased with Nook Miles, allowing Sable's themed designs to be worn as clothing or used as patterns for wallpaper and flooring.

Top 4 Fab Hairstyles can be purchased with Nook Miles to unlock 4 new hairstyles. Harriet will unlock a further 7 hairstyles, making for a total of 11 new hairstyle options introduced with the update.

Home improvements not listed here are options available to players who own the Happy Home Paradise DLC, which can eventually be integrated into the player's home once a certain threshold is met. These include partition walls, pillars, polishing, soundscapes, and lighting adjustments.

Island exterior improvements

The player's island using placed ladders to get up and down cliffs.
After building eight bridges and inclines, the Island Representative can redeem the Pro Construction License to increase the limit for building bridges and inclines from eight to ten.

Nine new fences are added and can be crafted, and both new and original fences can now be customized with a range of different colors.

The fences that can be customized include:

Corrugated iron fence
Frozen fence
Iron fence
Large lattice fence
Lattice fence
Park fence
Simple wooden fence
Vertical-board fence
Wedding fence
Zen fence
A new storage shed item allows the player to access their home storage when placed outside, while the ABD allows Bells to be deposited and withdrawn from wherever the item is placed. Plumeria bushes, in  pink or  white, were also added in the game, and can be obtained from Leif, on one of Kapp'n's boat tours, or from the teacher at the school in Happy Home Paradise. They bloom from June 1 - September 20 (Northern Hemisphere) and December 1 - March 20 (Southern Hemisphere).

Ladder set-up kits can be crafted, allowing ladders to be permanently placed for convenient access between different elevations of the island. They come in different styles, such as wooden, iron, vine, and golden. The wooden ladder set-up kit DIY recipe can be purchased from Nook's Cranny for  2,000 Bells, while the vine ladder set-up kit DIY recipe can be found on message bottles on Kapp'n's boat tours or on the main archipelago island in Happy Home Paradise, and the DIY recipes for the other ladder set-up kits from any villagers.

Cooking

An array of food created by the player.
The Be a Chef! DIY Recipes+ upgrade can be purchased from the Nook Stop to unlock the ability to cooking and various cooking recipes. Edible food can be crafted with a kitchenware by combining both the new and existing ingredients together. New ingredients include a variety of new harvestable flora that can be grown, such as tomatoes, potatoes, carrots, wheat, and sugarcane. Their produce starts are obtainable from Leif.

Cooking recipes can be found in the same ways that crafting recipes are found. Occasionally, villagers can now be found cooking in their houses instead of crafting and will give the player a cooking recipe when spoken to. Additionally, only in Happy Home Paradise can the player also receive daily cooking recipes from the chef at the restaurant.

Island life additions

The player asking Isabelle to enact an ordinance.
Island Life 101 is a new service that offers regular tips and guidance about life on the island, both via the app on the NookPhone and on the loading screen. The service can be obtained from Tom Nook at the beginning of the game or can be redeemed for  400 Nook Miles.

Ordinances, previously featured in Animal Crossing: New Leaf, return and can be enacted to passively affect various things on the island. As in New Leaf, these include Beautiful Island, Early Bird, Night Owl, and Bell Boom.

Group stretching, previously known as morning aerobics, return from Animal Crossing. They can occur outside Resident Services, where the player can participate in aerobic exercises using either button controls or motion controls.

Villagers can now periodically invite the player to visit their house, or may randomly visit the player's house while they are inside of it. When visiting, they may ask to play a new high-low minigame with the player. The villager will pick a card, and the player must guess if the number on the second card will be higher or lower than the first card.

Multiple new activities have been added to the Nook Mileage/Nook Miles+ program. New Nook Miles activities are "Writing a Cookbook?", "Mmm-Mmm-Miles!", "Nice to Meet You, Gyroid!", "Gyroid Getter", "Sprout Out Loud", "Executive Producer", "Set Sail for Adventure", "Come Home to the Roost", and "Stretch to Refresh!". New Nook Miles+ activities are "Plant Produce", "Water your Produce", "Cook up a Storm", "Refresh With a Group-Stretching Session" and "Visit the Roost for a Coffee Break".

The Pro Camera App can be purchased with Nook Miles, allowing the player to walk around with a handheld camera or set a tripod camera. It also adds four more filters to the app. Characters that get into frame with the player's camera will react and pose for pictures.

Multiple new reactions have also been added, and can be obtained via New Reactions Notebook, or by completing 50 group stretching sessions. Other new reactions not listed here are exclusive to the Happy Home Paradise DLC.

From group stretching once for 50 days:

 Posture Warm-Up
 Arm Circles

Other features

The player digging up a squeezoid.
Many new items have been added, with some obtainable from Nook's Cranny and Able Sisters, and others that can be exclusively obtained from the Nook Stop.

Gyroids return from previous games, featuring a smaller design than seen before and the ability to be customized. Gyroid fragments can be found and buried underground, and when watered they will turn into a gyroid which can be retrieved the next day. As in previous games, gyroids will sync their sound effects in time to any music playing nearby. As in previous games, fully-formed gyroids can be unearthed following rain on the player's island, or on mysterious islands that are experiencing rain.

Posters featuring illustrations of the items in each exhibit from the museum are received from Blathers after their respective exhibit is completed. The posters can be purchased from Blathers after they are first obtained.

Furniture selection
A new feature has been added to make it easier to search for stored items when using "Sort: Type" in Decorating Mode while in the player's home or other locations. As part of this change, adjustments have also been made to the order in which items are sorted. Additionally, when using the catalog at Photopia, it is now possible to select different variations of an item by using the X Button if the player has obtained different variations of the same item.

Exterior name changes

Wisp changes
Wisp's item gifts chances have changed. Prior to this update, the chances of getting a furniture item were significantly lower, the pricing range was much lower, and when selecting "Something expensive", Wisp would pull from two different Tables, with the second Table having a 10% of being used. In this update, Wisp's two Table setup has been removed, and now when selecting "Something expensive", Wisp will instead determine the item within the pricing range based on the status of Nook's Cranny. The pricing ranges and chance percentages have also been modified.[3]

Event changes

The 2021 celebratory arch under "Seasonal" in the Nook Shopping app.
Seasonal events (including Nook Shopping events) can now occur every year instead of requiring an update to be able to experience them in the current year. These events can now occur from the year 2000 to 2060, with Festivale and Bunny Day taking place on different days of the year.

Turkey Day changes
The ingredients that Franklin will ask for have changed. The Gratin recipe now has a chance to call for a carrot or a potato, and the Fish Meunière recipe now has a chance to call for flour.

After completing all four dishes, Franklin will now give the player the Turkey Day Recipes, a recipe pack that includes the four dishes that were created on Turkey Day.

Nook Shopping event changes
Items only obtainable via Nook Shopping events are now available to view through the catalog and are labeled under "Seasonal". They can be purchased during the time that its associated Nook Shopping seasonal event is ongoing.
Certain Nook Shopping events have different dates that occur each year. For instance, Moon-Viewing Day in 2022 takes place from September 1 to 10, while in 2023 it takes place from September 20 to 29. As a result, certain events that were added in 2020 no longer have the same dates that they had originally.
Ōmisoka, Silvester, Nochevieja, and the New Year's Eve Nook Shopping seasonal event now start on December 22 instead of December 26.
The Olivier salad is now available during the New Year's Eve Nook Shopping seasonal event instead of the New Year's Day seasonal event.
Shōgatsu and the New Year's Day Nook Shopping seasonal events now occur from December 22 to January 5.
Other changes

Orville denying the player from using most of the airport's functions.
Tools and goods are now orderable from Nook Shopping. However, only items that are obtainable from Nook's Cranny or Nook Shopping can be purchased.
Two previously unavailable stationeries—the Fireworks Card and Dawning-Year Card—were made available with a proper name.
DIY recipes can now be stored in the player's storage.
Isabelle will now announce which special character is appearing on the player's island in her daily broadcast.
However, if an event takes place, such as a villager's birthday, or a villager is visiting the campsite, then Isabelle will not announce which special character is visiting that day.
Villagers now contribute more Bells to public works than before.
Villagers now have more variation in their spoken dialogue.
Villagers can now wear custom designs at Photopia, even if they were not initially wearing them when brought there. However, they cannot wear designs that were transferred from New Leaf or Happy Home Designer.
The maximum number of designs that can be uploaded to the Custom Designs Portal has been increased to 200.
When dreaming, it is now possible to search for a destination by island name.
Orville will now prevent the player from flying or opening the gates for visitors if the player's island has not progressed their island to the next day (i.e. the day progresses to 5 AM on the player's island but the player is not outside their island or is on a different island for the day to properly roll-over and allow Isabelle to do her daily announcement). The player is required to leave the airport to enable Isabelle's announcements and allow the island to progress to the next day.
If the player is on Harv's Island or on the main archipelago island in Happy Home Paradise when the day rolls over, they cannot go to either location and can only go back to their main island.
The unique lines of dialogue displayed when attempting to invite special characters to the campsite through amiibo have been removed. The game now displays a standard message simply stating that the character cannot be invited.
Because Redd can set up permanent residence on Harv's commune, the player is no longer required to receive a piece of art from him to construct the museum's art wing. Instead, the art wing is automatically included once the museum is upgraded from a tent. This means that the entire process of unlocking the art wing is completely skipped, and the museum uses its expanded exterior from the start.
Bug fixes
An issue where only trash or stones could be obtained from created water features with a certain shape was fixed.
Items can no longer be placed on the fourth tier of cliffs (a normally inaccessible part from a ladder) and items that do exist are instead moved to the recycle box.
