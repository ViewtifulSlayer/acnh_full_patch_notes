Sanrio furniture

amiibo cards of the six Sanrio villagers.
Various Sanrio-themed items are added, many of which return from Welcome amiibo and Pocket Camp. They are available for purchase after their respective character's amiibo card is scanned. Unlike in Welcome amiibo, the Sanrio furniture items are now categorized under a furniture series. The Hello Kitty clock and My Melody clock items can no longer be placed on a table item.

Custom design improvements

The new custom design templates from the Custom Design Pro Editor+.
The Custom Design Pro Editor+, which can be purchased for  2,000 Nook Miles, allows the player to apply custom designs to umbrellas, uchiwa fans, flags, and standees.[3] This also grants 50 additional slots for both normal designs and Pro designs.[3] In addition, the Custom Designs Portal can be bought for  300 Nook Miles and can be used outside Able Sisters via the player's NookPhone.[3]

Events and holidays
Bunny Day
Bunny Day-themed items now appear in the seasonal spot at Nook's Cranny during the event, with some being exclusive to purchase from the store.[3]

Nook Shopping seasonal events

Players celebrating Prom.
Four new Nook Shopping seasonal events were added:[3]

April Fools' Day is celebrated from March 26 to April 1 with a whoopee cushion.
Singmogil is celebrated from April 1 to April 10 with a forsythia.
Prom, based upon traditional school proms, is celebrated from April 1 to April 30 with the prom sash, prom flooring, and prom wall.[4] In addition, Prom-themed clothing is available to purchase at the Able Sisters. As with Shamrock Day and Setsubun this is not time-locked like the corresponding Nook Shopping event.
Nature Day returns as a Nook Shopping seasonal event after being a regular event in 2020. Players can purchase a cool globe during this time from April 15 to April 22.

Changed features
Event changes
The 2021 date of Bunny Day has been activated, with the event now lasting eight days instead of twelve from March 28 to April 4. In the result of this change, the 2020 date of Bunny Day (April 1 to April 12) is no longer functional.

Similarly, Nature Day's 2020 dates of April 23 to May 4 have been disabled in favor of the Nook Shopping seasonal event. As a result, the Nook Miles+ achievements related to Nature Day are permanently inaccessible. As a result, the hedge fence item is now only available from Leif.

Furniture changes
The HHA themes of the celebratory candles, fortune-telling set, and wheelchair were changed.
The festivale drum was changed from a houseware to a miscellaneous furniture item. It can now be placed on top of table furnitures.
The Zen Series was renamed to the Imperial Series.
The names of the following HHA themes were changed:
Folk Art → Heritage
Garage → Workshop
Zen-Style → Harmonious
Other changes
When forcing a villager to mail a return gift by having a full inventory and gifting an item from a stack, a villager's photo is only in the potential return pool if individual items in the stack have a sell price of  750+ Bells. The previous price was 250+ Bells.
Villager's photos can now be placed on top of table items.
Bug fixes

A stone path with a single dug spot and various red roses.
An issue from version 1.4.0 where the player could not remove a wand outfit if they swapped their wand for another item while their pockets are full was fixed.
An issue from version 1.7.0 where placing down construction kits could allow the player to dig up holes on non-dirt or sand paths if they used the "Let me imagine it..." option and did not place down the plot was fixed. Any existing holes on those holes can remain until the player closes the hole themselves.
