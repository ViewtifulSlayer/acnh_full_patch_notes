Fireworks Show

Several players watching the fireworks.
The Fireworks Show returns in 1.4.0, happening every Sunday throughout August. Isabelle will give the player a random bopper hat and allow the player to submit up to ten custom fireworks from their custom designs during the show. Redd is present during the show operating a raffle stand for any handheld items for the Firework Show. Redd's hat changes depending on the hemisphere setting: he wears a straw boater in the northern hemisphere and a dandy hat in the southern hemisphere.

On the day of the Fireworks Show, Able Sisters will sell either the casual kimono, kabuki-actor yukata, or morning-glory yukata, clothing traditionally associated with hanabi taikai in Japan

Nook Shopping seasonal event

The player wearing a Grape-Harvest Basket.
New Nook Shopping seasonal events include the following events:

Cowboy Festival, meant to coincide with the traditional Brazilian Festa do Peão de Barretos, is celebrated throughout August with a rodeo-style springy ride-on.
Cowherd & Weaver Girl Day, meant to coincide with the Chinese Qixi Festival observed in multiple parts of Asia, is celebrated throughout August with Hikoboshi outfit and Orihime outfit.
In celebration of various harvest festivities in Europe, the Grape Harvest Festival is held during September with a grape-harvest basket.
Moon-Viewing Day, meant to coincide with the real-life Mid-Autumn Festival, is celebrated from September 7 to October 8 with a moon rug.
Luna and dream islands

The player entering a dream island.
The dream mechanic returns in 1.4.0, alongside the proprietor Luna. Players can upload their own dream islands or visit any other dream islands. Unlike New Leaf, there is no charge to enter a dream island, and accessing a dream island requires a bed item to sleep on.

Once inside a dream island, the player will be unable to access most of the apps on their NookPhone. Whenever the player catches a creature, they will note that they're in a dream. Resident Services, Nook's Cranny, and Able Sisters will be shut down while visiting a dream island, however the airport will remain open, allowing a special interaction with Orville to occur.

Other features
A new feature was added to the NookPhone Camera app, allowing the player to turn off the guide information by pressing in the R Stick.
A new feature has been added to the Custom Designs Portal which allows searching by design name or type. Additionally, players can now create a list of favorite creators.
A new feature has been added for backing up save data to Nintendo's servers via the internet. Players can use backed up save data with the island backup restoration service if their Nintendo Switch system is lost or broken.
