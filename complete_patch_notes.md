### Version 1.2.0 - April Free Update (April 23, 2020)

#### Bushes

Bushes have been reintroduced from New Leaf in 1.2.0, with all but sweet-olive bushes returning. In order of blooming dates, the following bushes have been added:

- Camellia bushes, in red or white, bloom January 1–March 31 (northern hemisphere) and June 16–September 30 (southern hemisphere)

- Azalea bushes, in pink or white, bloom April 11–May 31 (northern hemisphere) and October 11–November 30 (southern hemisphere)

- Hydrangea bushes, in blue or pink, bloom June 1–July 20 (northern hemisphere) and December 1–January 20 (southern hemisphere)

- Hibiscus bushes, in red or yellow, bloom July 21–September 20 (northern hemisphere) and January 21–March 20 (southern hemisphere)

- Tea-olive bushes, in orange or yellow, bloom September 21–October 31 (northern Hemisphere) and March 21–April 30 (southern hemisphere)

- Holly bushes bloom November 1–December 31 (northern hemisphere) and May 1–June 15 (southern hemisphere)

#### Leif

Leif makes his return selling bushes, alongside non-native flowers. He also offers to buy any clumps of weeds that the player may have in their inventory for  100 Bells. Outside of Nature Day, he is the source of the DIY recipe for a hedge.

#### Art

Jolly's Redd Treasure Trawler, featuring several paintings, one statues, and two furniture items.
The art mechanic returns in 1.2.0, and just like New Leaf, has forgeries that the player must look very closely to check its authentication. While the fine painting and neutral painting do not return from New Leaf, and several new painting have been added: the detailed painting, glowing painting, mysterious painting, sinking painting, and twinkling painting. All the statues from New Leaf return, with the new statues being familiar statue, informative statue, rock-head statue, tremendous statue, and warrior statue. Unlike New Leaf, there is no forgery for the great statue.

Redd returns to sell art as well as non-native furniture, now operating a ship called Jolly Redd's Treasure Trawler. His ship is docked at the small beach at the top of the island. Players can now ask Redd for closer examination of the artwork to check for authenticity. Redd will only appear after the player has donated 60 items to the museum.

Once a piece of art has been donated to the museum, Blathers will close the museum the next day for renovations in order to open the new art exhibit. The art exhibit lays out most of the Statues at the entrance of the exhibit, followed by Renaissance and Baroque paintings at the top of the exhibit, and more modern and Asian arts on the left.

#### Events and Holidays

Several new holidays were introduced in 1.2.0.

##### Nature Day

Nature Day makes its return as a method to obtain additional Nook Miles. Tom Nook will offer bonus Nook Miles+ objectives for the player to achieve, and after completing the first Nature Day-related task a DIY recipe for a hedge. 

##### May Day

May Day is a new event that runs from May 1 to May 7, where the player must traverse through a maze utilizing much of the game mechanics of New Horizons. At the end of the maze, Rover will greet the player, and offer Rover's briefcase as an award. Bell vouchers are also dispersed throughout the maze.

This event is time-locked, and only unlocks on 1.2.xa. 

##### International Museum Day

International Museum Day is a new event that runs from May 18 to May 31. During the event, the player should explore around the museum across the bug, fish, and fossil exhibits for the location of stamp rallies. Once the player obtains all the stamps in one exhibit, Blathers will offer the respective plaque as an award to the player: bug plaque for the bug exhibit, fish plaque for the fish exhibit, and fossil plaque for the fossil exhibit.

This event is time-locked, and only unlocks on 1.2.xb. 

##### Wedding Season

Wedding Season is a new event that runs through the entirety of June, and primarily takes place on Harv's Island. Reese and Cyrus asks the player to take a photoshoot using related wedding furniture, in exchange for heart crystals to be sold for Wedding Series.

After a few days, the player can invite their own villagers or special characters to participate in a makeshift party, and the player is rewarded from Harvey a recipe for a wedding fence and from Cyrus a recipe for a wedding wand. The player can continue to play in the event until the end of June, and Reese will challenge the player by using different wedding themes for their photo.

This event is time-locked, and only unlocks on 1.2.xc. 

##### Nook Shopping seasonal event

New to 1.2.0 is the introduction of seasonal items in Nook Shopping. These events are all time-locked and only unlock at their specified time-range. The following are events celebrated through this new service:

- Mother's Day, a day dedicated to mothers, is celebrated throughout May with a thank-you Mom mug.

- International Children's Day, a day dedicated to all children, is celebrated throughout June with handmade cape and handmade crown.

- Father's Day, a day dedicated to fathers, is celebrated throughout June with a thank-you Dad mug.

- The Summer Solstice and Winter Solstice are both celebrated between June 7 and July 6 with sunflower crown for summer and midwinter sweater for winter. Until 1.6.0, they were available for both hemispheres.

#### Other features

Wilbur now allows the player to send any items they have to their storage or be sold directly to Nook's Cranny. These options are only available past May 31, 2020 for usage in Wedding Season.

### Version 1.3.0 - Free Summer Update Wave 1 (July 3, 2020)

#### Sea creatures and swimming

Sea creatures and the swimming mechanic make their return in 1.3.0. In order to obtain sea creatures, the player must obtain a wet suit from either Nook's Cranny, Nook Shopping, or Nook Stop.

There are 40 sea creatures in total, ten more than New Leaf. New sea creatures include sea pig, slate pencil urchin, moon jellyfish, mussel, whelk, gigas giant clam, umbrella octopus, vampire squid, firefly squid, gazami crab, dungeness crab, sea pineapple, and Venus' flower basket. The ear shell, clam, and horsehair crab did not return from New Leaf. The museum will host any sea creatures in the already existing fish exhibit. 

#### New characters

##### Pascal

Pascal makes his return in 1.3.0, appearing when a player catches a Scallop. If the player chooses to give their scallop to Pascal, he will give them either a DIY recipe in the Mermaid Series, a mermaid fishy dress, a mermaid princess dress, or a pearl. Pearls can also be found from a small, stationary shadow, and can be used for DIY recipes. However, Pearls are not considered a sea creature.

##### Gullivarrr

Gullivarrr was a new NPC added in 1.3.0, with a similar mission as Gulliver, but requiring the player to dive in to find his communicator. When completed, he will mail the player any furniture from the Pirate Series or pirate-themed clothing.

#### Events and holidays

A new Nook Shopping seasonal event has been added. To celebrate Tanabata, a traditional Japanese festival, bamboo grass is available to purchase throughout July.

### Version 1.4.0 - Summer Update Wave 2 (July 30, 2020)

#### Events and holidays

##### Fireworks shows

The Fireworks Show returns in 1.4.0, happening every Sunday throughout August. Isabelle will give the player a random bopper hat and allow the player to submit up to ten custom fireworks from their custom designs during the show. Redd is present during the show operating a raffle stand for any handheld items for the Firework Show. Redd's hat changes depending on the hemisphere setting: he wears a straw boater in the northern hemisphere and a dandy hat in the southern hemisphere.

On the day of the Fireworks Show, Able Sisters will sell either the casual kimono, kabuki-actor yukata, or morning-glory yukata, clothing traditionally associated with hanabi taikai in Japan 

##### Nook Shopping seasonal event

New Nook Shopping seasonal events include the following events:

- Cowboy Festival, meant to coincide with the traditional Brazilian Festa do Peão de Barretos, is celebrated throughout August with a rodeo-style springy ride-on.

- Cowherd & Weaver Girl Day, meant to coincide with the Chinese Qixi Festival observed in multiple parts of Asia, is celebrated throughout August with Hikoboshi outfit and Orihime outfit.

- In celebration of various harvest festivities in Europe, the Grape Harvest Festival is held during September with a grape-harvest basket.

- Moon-Viewing Day, meant to coincide with the real-life Mid-Autumn Festival, is celebrated from September 7 to October 8 with a moon rug.

#### Luna and dream islands

The dream mechanic returns in 1.4.0, alongside the proprietor Luna. Players can upload their own dream islands or visit any other dream islands. Unlike New Leaf, there is no charge to enter a dream island, and accessing a dream island requires a bed item to sleep on.

Once inside a dream island, the player will be unable to access most of the apps on their NookPhone. Whenever the player catches a creature, they will note that they're in a dream. Resident Services, Nook's Cranny, and Able Sisters will be shut down while visiting a dream island, however the airport will remain open, allowing a special interaction with Orville to occur. 

#### Other features

- A new feature was added to the NookPhone Camera app, allowing the player to turn off the guide information by pressing in the R Stick.

- A new feature has been added to the Custom Designs Portal which allows searching by design name or type. Additionally, players can now create a list of favorite creators.

- A new feature has been added for backing up save data to Nintendo's servers via the internet. Players can use backed up save data with the island backup restoration service if their Nintendo Switch system is lost or broken.
